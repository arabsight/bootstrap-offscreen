# Bootstrap Better Nav

### Tiny library that replaces the default Bootstrap navbar collapse with an elegant off-screen menu.

No configuration and no additional HTML markup required. Just include the library's JavaScript and CSS files, and your new navigation is ready.

## Installation

The library works only in Bootstrap 4 projects and requires a valid Navbar to be present on the page.

To use it, simply include its CSS and JavaScript in your HTML. You can find the necessary files in the `/dist` directory of this project.

```html
<!-- In <head> after the Bootstrap CSS. -->
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/arabsight/bootstrap-offscreen/dist/bootstrap-offscreen.css"
/>

<!-- At the end of <body>, after jQuery and the Bootstrap js -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/arabsight/bootstrap-offscreen/dist/bootstrap-offscreen.js"></script>
```

Once the JavaScript is included in the page the library is automatically enabled. A new off-screen menu is added to the HTML, which is synced with the contents of your navbar automatically.

```html
<div id="side-menu">
  <button class="close"><span aria-hidden="true">Ã—</span></button>
  <div class="contents">
    <!-- The items from the Bootstrap Navbar will be copied here by the library. -->
  </div>
</div>
```

Clicking on the navbar toggle button will show the off-screen menu instead of expanding the Bootstrap navbar.

The menu has only basic styling, you can easily customize it with CSS.

## Configuring menu direction

The slide-in menu can be positioned on the left or the right side of the screen. By default it is on the right, but that can be easily changed by adding the `better-bootstrap-nav-left` class to the Bootstrap navbar.

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-md better-bootstrap-nav-left"></nav>
```
